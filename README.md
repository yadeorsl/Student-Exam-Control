## Learning Object-Oriented Programming
This project serves as a practical example for learning object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It demonstrates the use of classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to model a simple student grading system.

# Student-Exam-Control
This Java program is designed to check whether a student has passed or failed based on their exam grades in three courses. It includes classes for `Teacher`, `Course`, and `Student`.

## Classes

### Teacher
The `Teacher` class represents a teacher with attributes such as name, phone number, and branch.

### Course
The `Course` class represents a course with attributes such as name, code, and prefix. It also has methods to assign a teacher to the course and print teacher information.

### Student
The `Student` class represents a student with attributes such as name, student number, enrolled courses, and exam grades. It includes methods to add exam grades, print the grades, calculate the average, and determine if the student passed or failed.
